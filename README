go to client diretory :

1. run : npm install
2. run : npm start

go to server directory :

1. run : npm install
2. run : nodemon server.js

while downloading u can only access, the files that you uploaded.
As i am giving the same mongo atlas database.
While displaying them , u would get names of files i uploaded.
and i am using multer to store files in local storage.
and storing their paths in monogodb atlas database.
So, u can not download the files , which i/other than u uploaded.

now both react and node servers are running.

this project using my atlas database.

so , you no need to do anything with database.

if you want to use your own database then you have to change the database url in .env file in server directory.
